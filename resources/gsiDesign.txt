We are planning to expand our service with the following operation:

`GetEventsForOrganizer`
   * Retrieve all `Event` data for a provided `organizerId`

1. Which table contains the data necessary for the operation?

2. Explain why we cannot use load or query on the base table to retrieve this data.

3. Design the GSI we would create for `GetEventsForOrganizer`.
   - What table would we create the GSI for?

   -  What is the partition key of the GSI?

   -  Does the GSI have a sort key? If so, what?

   -  What attributes from the base table need to be projected to the GSI?

   -  What are the pros/cons of using INCLUDE vs ALL for the attribute projection in this case?

   - Which will you use?
